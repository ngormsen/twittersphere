    </header>

    <main>
        <p>- The following "articles" are based on daily use of Twitter over 8 years and over 1,800 bookmarked tweets.<br>
            - I curate relevant bookmarks that have helped form and best represent my opinions on a broad set of subjects I've become interested in over the years.<br>
            - I use AI to write the articles. The result is linguistically mediocre but gets the job done as the tweets
            mostly speak for themselves and I am not an avid writer anyway.<br>
            - The tweets are mostly from sources with a good track record. I have followed some of them for multiple years
            and find their takes to be more informed than most of the stuff I read in classic newspapers.</p>
